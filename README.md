# BINUS Logbook

A simple desktop application to help BINUS students save time filling the logbooks

### Installation

TODO

### Features
- Fill logbooks without the annoying UI and slow website
- No need to click 100000x times to go to the enrichment page

### How does it work?

Because we don't have direct access to BINUS API, we're going to instead scrap their website. Obviously in order to do operations on your logbook, we need to login to your account first. But no worries, this application stroes your data locally (one of the reason why we chose this to be a desktop application instead) and just forward it to the scraper. Then, the scraper will navigate to the enrichment page and scrape all the logbook data. Once you fill the logbook in this app, you can synchronize the logbooks where the scraper will fill it up for you instead and you don't have to wait for all of them to be filled!
